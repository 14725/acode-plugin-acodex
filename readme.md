## Features

- **Easy to use**: _AcodeX_ offers a terminal in the form of a movable panel, which can be accessed easily by pressing `Ctrl+K` or by searching for "Open Terminal" in the command palette.
- **Productivity**: By using _AcodeX_, developers can save time by accessing the terminal directly within _Acode_ and executing commands without switching between apps.
- **Terminal panel**: The terminal panel can be moved around, resized, minimized, and maximized based on the developer's preferences
- **User-friendly interface**: _AcodeX_ offers a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy to use for all levels of developers.
- **Customisable**: You can customise AcodeX terminal according to your preference 

## Prerequisites

To use **AcodeX**, you need to have the **Termux app** installed on your Android device. However, you do not need to switch between apps to use the terminal, as **AcodeX** offers a convenient way to access the terminal directly within the **Acode app** with the help of **Termux**

## Limitations

Although **AcodeX** is a useful plugin but there is a limitation with the `mobile keyboard` when using the terminal. This is a known issue, and the developer is working to fix it. For the time being, users can use the `input fields` to enter commands if the mobile keyboard is not working. Note that this limitation is not specific to **AcodeX**, but rather an issue with xtermjs, the terminal emulator used by the plugin.

## Installation

Install plugin in **Acode App** From `Acode > Settings > Plugins > AcodeX`
And Install server in termux via below command:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bajrangCoder/acode-plugin-acodex/main/installServer.sh | bash
```

## Acknowledgements

**AcodeX** is made possible by the use of:

 - [xtermjs](https://xtermjs.org/)
 - [node-pty](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty)



## How it works?

**AcodeX** runs a *Node.js* script in **Termux**, which connects with the plugin via a *WebSocket* and communicates with each other to work. 
**Termux** is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app, which enables users to access the terminal directly from their Android devices.
