# [AcodeX - Terminal Emulator](https://github.com/bajrangCoder/acode-plugin-acodex)

This is my own fork, and I don't think it looks good to contribute. 

Click the link below to the origin/upstream. 

## Installation

Build it, then install it with "Local". 
See Acode Plugin docs for detail.

Then replace the origin server (Located in `$HOME/.acodeX-server` ) with the [`index.js`](server/index.js) here. 
    
## What the difference? 

(Maybe) Don't stuck on large rushing output.
